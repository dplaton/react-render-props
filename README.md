# React Render Props Example

(This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))

This is a very simple project I created for myself to study render-props. At the moment it only does the "list-view"/"grid-view" rendering trick, but it'll slowly evolve as I learn more about different subjects (ok, it's not only about render props);
